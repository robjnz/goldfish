    <p>The goldfish <i>Carassius auratus</i> is a freshwater fish in the family <i>Cyprinidae</i> of order <i>Cypriniformes</i>. <br>It was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish.</p>
    
   

<p> A relatively small member of the carp family <em><b>which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp</b></em>, <br>the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colourful carp <i>Carassius auratus</i> native to east Asia. <br>It was first domesticated in China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. <br><br>Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and colouration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).</p>
 <br>
<p id class="shadow"> The mutation that gave rise to the domestic goldfish is also known from other <i>cyprinid</i> species, such as common carp and tench. </p>
